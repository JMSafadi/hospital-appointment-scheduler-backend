**Project Description:**
Create a hospital appointment scheduling system. Patients can enter their symptoms or required specialization (e.g., cardiology, surgery), and the system will find the nearest available appointment date with a doctor of the specified specialization. The system should consider doctor availability, patient load, and appointment duration.
